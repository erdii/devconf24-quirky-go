		<pre>A careful programmer will check the return value of close(),
since it is quite possible that errors on a previous write(2)
operation are reported only on the final close() that releases
the open file description.  Failing to check the return value
when closing a file may lead to silent loss of data.</pre>

A careful programmer who wants to know about I/O errors may
precede close() with a call to fsync(2).</pre>
