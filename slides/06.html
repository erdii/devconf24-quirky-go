			the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html#NOTES">
				man pages for close(2)

		</p>
		<pre>A careful programmer will check the return value of close(),
since it is quite possible that errors on a previous write(2)
operation are reported only on the final close() that releases
the open file description.  Failing to check the return value
when closing a file may lead to silent loss of data.</pre>

<pre class="fragment">[...]

A careful programmer who wants to know about I/O errors may
precede close() with a call to fsync(2).</pre>
